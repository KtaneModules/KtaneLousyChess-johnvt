            <p class="flavour-text">It’s like playing random moves. Only worse.</p>

            <p>Two lousy <a href="https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess">chess</a> engines are playing against
                each other. It’s up to you to predict their moves. The game is
                already in progress. Keep playing moves until the game comes to a conclusion.<br></p>

            <p>The variant played is <a href="http://wiki.cs.pdx.edu/mc-howto/rules.html" target="_blank">MinitChess</a>.
                It’s played on a 5&times;4 board with less pieces — see diagram. Bishops have the additional
                option of moving to any adjacent <b>empty</b> square, allowing them to change color. Furthermore there
                is
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>no castling,</li>
                <li>no double pawn moves,</li>
                <li>no draw by repetition or moves after capture,</li>
                <li>pawn promotion only to queen,</li>
                <li>no “check” or “stalemate”,</li>
                <li>victory by king capture,</li>
                <li>victory when an opponent has no legal move,</li>
                <li>and draw after 40 moves by each side.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The engines</h3>
            <p>Every engine follows these steps to determine their next move: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you can capture the enemy king, do so. Victory!</li>
                <li>Otherwise, determine the move(s) that meet the goal.</li>
                <li>If there’s only one, that’s the next move.</li>
                <li>If there are more than one, use the RNG explained below to determine which piece will move. And
                    again
                    to determine where it will move to.
                </li>
                <li>If there are none, continue to the next goal.</li>
                <li>If no goals can be met, the goal is any valid move.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>RNG: n = <b>seed</b> + <b>current move</b> (both mentioned on the module). Count n valid moves that meet
                the goal, ordered alphabetically by starting location, then target location. (The very first possible
                move would be <b>a1-a2</b>, the last move would be <b>e6-e5</b>). Loop back to the first move if you
                reached the last valid move.</p>
            <p>Distance is measured in straight lines. E.g. the distance between the queens in starting position is 7,
                between the kings is 9.</p>
            <p>Where it reads "move" in the engine goals, capturing is evenly valid.</p>
